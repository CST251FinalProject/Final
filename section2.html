<h1>Saftey is a Priority: REPLACE REPLACE</h1>
  <p>Parnaz Hojjati from Michigan health reccomends if one is to travel despite the risks the pandemic places on tus there are a few things to gravitate towards. In their words, "if you do choose to travel this summer, Patel advises avoiding large groups of people. Instead, traveling with your household and keeping your circle small lowers your risk of infection and the chances of infecting others. This could come in the form of road tripping, short day trips, camping or any activities that involve minimal contact with others."</p>
